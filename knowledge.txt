This is a sample knowledge base for the CAIEC training project.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to learn and make decisions. It has been particularly successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation. It retrieves relevant documents or text chunks from a knowledge base and uses them as context to generate more accurate and informed responses.

FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. It's designed for high performance and easy to use, with automatic interactive API documentation.

Ollama is a tool that allows you to run large language models locally on your machine. It provides an API for interacting with models like Llama, Mistral, and other open-source LLMs.

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Similar texts have similar embeddings, which allows for semantic search and similarity matching.
